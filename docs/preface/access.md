# IBM i Access and Software

This book relies on having access to IBM i V7R3+. 
At my current workplace I was lucky enough to be given access to IBM i. Otherwise, this book would have never been made.
Unfortunately, I believe it is getting harder to find sites to get IBM i access.


## Timeshares
Timeshares will allow you to connect remotely to a public IBM i session.
* http://www.pub400.com/
* http://www.rikascom.net/
* http://www.timeshare400.com/

Unfortunately, timeshare sites tend to be full and the system you use may not be updated to the current OS.


## Software
* IBM Access Client Solutions - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010355
* ILE Editor - https://github.com/worksofbarry/ILEditor

## Visual Studio Code
There is now an extension [code-for-ibmi](https://github.com/halcyon-tech/code-for-ibmi)
that allows you to maintain your RPGLE, CL, COBOL, C/CPP on IBM i right from Visual Studio Code.
