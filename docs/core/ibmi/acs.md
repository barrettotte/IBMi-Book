# Access Client Solutions (ACS)

<br>

**ATTENTION!**
The rest of this book assumes that you gained the trust of a wise IBMi developer
and they set you up with a user profile and a user library. 


## Installation

Since this is already documented in IBM documentation, I will not be retyping it here.
Hopefully, this page doesn't go anywhere in the near future https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/obtaining-ibm-i-access-client-solutions


If for some reason this page disappears, I'll update this book with the missing information.


## Getting Started

Upon launching Access Client Solutions, you are greeted with this screen.

## Setting up a System Connection

In order to do anything here, a system connection has to be configured.
Click on **Management** > **System Configurations** > **New** . Enter the **server name** and optionally a **description**.

Click on the **Connection** tab. This is personal preference, but I set **Prompt for user name and password every time**
<br>

Click **Ok** > **Close** and now the connection can be selected here

As the book goes on, I'll touch on a bit more of ACS roughly in the following sections:

* **5250 Emulator** - This chapter
* **Schemas** and **Run SQL Scripts** - DB2 SQL
* **Integrated File System** - This chapter (briefly)


I should probably learn how to use some of the other sections, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
