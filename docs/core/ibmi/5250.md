## Introduction to the 5250 Emulator

This is an emulator of the IBM 5250 terminal originally used to interact with IBM i and its ancestors. A bit more information on it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5250

There's a lot of features in this emulator that I haven't messed around with.

One important thing I learned is using the **popup keypad** located in **Actions** > **Popup Keypad...**
Sometimes when things go wrong, you have to use **SysReq** to bail yourself out (more on this later).

## Screen Size
The screen size is dreadfully small when in full screen, so let's fix that before doing anything else. 

This step is **optional**, sometimes putting the dimension to a full 132 columns can
mess up some font/displays. Its up to you, but I usually stay at 80 column width.

Go to ```Communication > Configure... > Connection``` and adjust the screen dimension to **27x132**.
This will make it so we display at a full 132 columns instead of just 80.

Additionally, we have to change the font since it is now being stretched from the dimension change.
Go to ```Communication > Configure... > Font```. I found that setting Font Name to **Lucida Console** works nicely.

Click **Ok** and you will have to restart your 5250 session.
Now you should be able to maximize the window and not strain your eyes.
Make sure that you click ```File > Save``` and save your profile configuration somewhere.


## Signing In (Again)
Now you have to sign in again within the green screen.

Upon signing in, you are greeted with the **IBM i Main Menu**

## Setting up a Watermark
If you're going to be messing around in different environments, I would highly suggest setting this up.
Most importantly, making sure that you have no doubt in your head if you are in a production environment.
This can be achieved with a custom watermark.


From the ACS main menu, go into **5250 Emulator** > **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Watermark...**

I use this configuration, but setup anything that makes sense.

Clearly this is a little visually jarring, but there is no doubt that you are in a production environment.
